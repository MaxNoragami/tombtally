# Welcome to TombTally!

👋 Hi! This is my Individual Work project for my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) Course. I was required to create a pension calculator that would compute the pension amount of various pension types.

🧑‍💻 The core program that does the computation is written in C, the rest of the languages were used to create a better user experience and a text-based database, that's used for the login system and for storing the data of users.

📃 To run the program you must have installed:
- VS Code;
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brapifra.phpserver ;
- Flask;
- Latest PHP version;
- Latest Python Version;
- And others...


⚙️ Steps to make the program work:
 1. Open the "cexec" folder;
 2. Open the main.c file;
 3. Hit "Run" so that the "main.exe" file gets built;
 4. Open the index.html;
 5. Right-click on the code area;
 6. Hit the "PHP Server: Reload Server";
 7. Open the app.py file;
 8. Hit "Run";
 9. Open the page opened in your browser;
 10. Enjoy using TombTally! 🎉
